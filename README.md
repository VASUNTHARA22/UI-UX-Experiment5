# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:

To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).

## Algorithm:
1.Identify user pain points. Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using a defined template: "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

2.Identifying Appropriate Research Methods Identify the most suitable research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing, diary studies). Justify your method choice.

Creating Personas Based on previous user data or a given user scenario.
4.Create at least two user personas with: Demographics Goals Behaviors Pain points Motivation Submission:

5.Mention the GitHub Repo URL in the submission text and attach the lab report pdf.

## Output:

UX project scenarios
Scenario 1: Designing a Mobile Health Tracking
1. Problem Statements
User Pain Points Identified:
Users struggle to track their daily health habits.
Existing apps are too complex or have too many features.
Users forget to log health data or find it time-consuming.
Problem Statement 1:
"Health-conscious users need a way to easily and quickly log their
daily health metrics because existing apps are overwhelming and
time-consuming, which results in low engagement and inconsistent
tracking."
Problem Statement 2:
"Busy professionals need a way to receive timely health reminders
because they often forget to log meals, water, or workouts, which
results in incomplete data and reduced goal progress."
2. Appropriate Research Methods
Recommended Methods:
Interviews: To understand personal health habits, motivations, and
frustrations with current solutions.
Diary Studies: To capture real-time behavior around health tracking
and logging across a week.
Usability Testing: To test early prototypes for ease of logging and
navigation.
Justification:
Interviews reveal deep emotional motivators and pain points.
Diary studies allow observation of natural usage habits over time.
Usability testing ensures that the solution simplifies and acceleratesdaily logging.
